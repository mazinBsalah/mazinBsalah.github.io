        <h2>Welcome</h2>
        <p>Hello! My name is <strong>Mazin Salah</strong>, and Iâ€™m a <strong>Computer Science student at NC State University (May 2026)</strong> with a passion for <strong>software development, security, and AI</strong>.</p>
        <p>I began my journey with little experience and have since built a strong foundation in <strong>coding, problem-solving, and software engineering principles</strong>. My time at NC State has been one of <strong>continuous learning, collaboration, and growth</strong>, allowing me to gain <strong>hands-on experience and research</strong> that have shaped me into a <strong>versatile and adaptive developer</strong>.</p>
        <p>I have developed and contributed to projects using <strong>C, Java, HTML, JavaScript, and more</strong>, applying <strong>problem-solving techniques</strong> to build <strong>efficient solutions</strong>. Additionally, I have conducted <strong>research and hacking exercises</strong>, utilizing <strong>penetration testing tools and vulnerability analysis</strong> to <strong>identify and mitigate security threats</strong>.</p>
        <p>Beyond technical skills, I actively <strong>network with industry professionals</strong> to gain insights into <strong>career development, software engineering best practices, and research advancements</strong>. I am always seeking opportunities to <strong>refine my skills and contribute to impactful projects</strong>, whether through <strong>AI-driven applications, research, or full-stack development</strong>.</p>
